// creating a new user
// url should be a noun not a verb

// 1 - Signup
// POST /api/users
// body 
// {
//   email,
//   password
// } 

// 2 - Login 
// when a user login they are basically creating a session 
// for themselves
// POST /api/sessions
// body
// {
//   email,
//   password
// }

you will take the session object if fot the particular session 
a user logged in you will set the userId

now whenever we get a request and you identify that this is the 
cookie id and this is the session we know which user the session belongs to 

// 3 updating the information about the user 
PUT /api/users/me

{
  firstName,
  lastName
}

// session and cookie are different in the places that their 
// data is stored
// A cookie has it data stored in the browser, 
// and that browser is going to attach that cookie key-value 
// pair to every http request that it does 

// Session on the other hand is going to stored on the 
// server side 
// Session data is not saved in the cookie itself, just the session ID. 
// Session data is stored server-side.
