when a user correctly send for example a username or
password for the first time. The server then generates
a random string said as token

Sessions based authentication means that upon a successful login, a “session” entry containting the user data is created in the Database or an In-Memory Store like Redis on the Server, while a cookie with an expiry date, containing a sessionID to this session entry is sent to the client, this cookie is then automatically sent with each request, which is accepted by the server if it is not expired, and access is granted as a logged in user

Now you have set the cookie so for every post or get request the cookie is also sent to the server

Now the backend is receiving the cookie it can identify the user that made this request based on the cookie

sessions has the information about the cookies

userCredntials has emails and passwords

users has informations about the users firstame lastname email whatever you want to store about the user 

the session object contain the session id and userId.
whenever we get any further request we can identify any user by session object and userid.
